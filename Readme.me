Dear graders,

Please find the data analysis in the "climate.ipynb" Jupyter notebook file, and the API app in the "climate_app.py" file in the SurfsUp directory.
The starter code is in the "Starter Code" directory.
Both directories contain the database in the resources subdirectory.

Have a great day!
